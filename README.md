# P2T

## What is P2T?
At its core, P2T is an OCR app. Meaning users can take a picture of something containing text, and the text from that image will be converted into a raw, editable form. Additionally, P2T supports speech to text, giving users another option if they are not in a position to take a photo. Converted text can then be saved into files, and these files can then be named, organized into folders, shared with others, or edited whenever the user wishes.

## How do I use it?
P2T is not available on the Google Play Store at this time, so if you wish to run it, you will need to clone this repository onto a machine that has Android Studio installed. From there the app can be run in an emulator or installed on any android device.
